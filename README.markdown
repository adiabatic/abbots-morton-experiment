# Abbots Morton Experiment

Abbots Morton Experiment is a sans-serif with nonzero, increasing support for OpenType features like contextual alternates (for upside-down .No and alternate .Utter) and cursive positioning (to join letters to each other).

See it in action [on the blog at frogorbits.com][blog] â€” currently, letters only are joined properly in Firefox.
